		<p><img src="images/fish1.gif" style="float:left; width:50%; height:40vh, border:none;">This project was fun because I got to find an image and then open it in a program it was never intended to be compatable with, alter it, and reopen it to discover the image had changed since the alteration. For this project I chose a nice picture of a jellyfish and opened it in Word Pad, I changed a single digit to a zero and then reopened it in Adobe Photoshop. The subsequent glitches were caused by the deletion and rearrangement of various lines of code in Word Pad. Once I had all of my glitches, I loaded them onto Adobe Photoshop and created a GIF.</p>
