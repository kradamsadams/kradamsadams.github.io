		<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/258308270" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>The goal of this project was to create a story through the use of video; this story was to be told without the help of direct narration. The use of different angles and shots would help compose a story with dimension. Additionally, the sounds for this video were to be made with at least four separate sound files.I wanted to made a light-hearted and fun video, and in the past I had enjoyed using paint and googly eyes to transform random objects into animals. I decided to develop a story loosley based around some of the characters from The Lion King. This video is stop-motion, meaning I took hundreds of individual pictures and edited them together to create a video. The soundtrack was intended to emulate a marching beat and to help reinforce the playful nature of the video. I recorded sounds such as car doors slamming, popcorn kernels shaking, and pencils tapping to create the sounds for this video. I used Adobe Premier Pro and Audition to make this video.</p>
