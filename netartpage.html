	<p>This net art project was intended to reflect how the internet is used by many people to discover and also create humorous memes and gifs that correlate to popular culture. I utilized the famous celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay to illustrate this point because there are countless memes and gifs of his comical food reviews all over the internet. This project is nonlinear in the respect that the user/player is offered many different options and pathways to take as they navigate through a virtual cooking show. Once the player has “made” their dish, a gif of Gordon Ramsay appears to critique their work. This is where popular culture combines with internet culture; each gif of Gordon Ramsay is a negative review of the food or of the player’s cooking skills. While this project can be classified as a game or an exercise, the player will never actually succeed in pleasing Gordon Ramsay and will continue to either try and fail or they will eventually give up. The fact that there is no way to win this game/exercise is a concept that not a lot of internet games employ since users would likely become frustrated and uncooperative. However, the enjoyment that the player gets from this net art game is in experiencing the variety of Gordon Ramsay reactions this cooking game has. This game subverts traditional gaming conventions by not including the option of winning because the experience lies in the exploration and not in simply trying to win. The user is forced to understand the exercise as a nonlinear path through the land of disappointment but that it can still be a fun experience even if they don’t technically “win”. This project is intended to be light-hearted and fun, but also to be a lesson in acceptance and perseverance. Players are continually given the option to try again or cry and give up; it’s up to the individual to decide their path.</p>
