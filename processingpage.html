		<p><img src="images/processingportrait.jpg" style="float:left; width:50%; height:60vh; border:none;">The processing project was interesting becuase it required an understanding of the spacial relationships between the various elements both in the self portrait and the bouncing ball modification. The process consisted of lots of trial and error in order to get things to look the way I wanted. I liked using simple geometric shapes to create the self portrait because I am a fan of a deconstructed style. The bouncing ball modification is cool because the size of the circle is directly related to the speed of the mouse. When the mouse is pressed, the circle is drawn in yellow; when it isn't pressed, the circle is drawn in blue.</p>
